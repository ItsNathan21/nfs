NFS Heirarchy (I spelt it wrong) 
Very RAFT inspired pls read the RAFT paper :3
Kinda uses RAFT as a guideline to sync file metadata across all server machines. 
However, each machine may store different actual data, all servers need to know about 
which servers contain which files, so in the case of failure of a server, they can be recovered, 
and also if someone wants to read the file or get contents they can actually do that :3


SERVERS:
    These are the file servers constantly working in the background. They recevie requests from users 
    to store new files. Below is the server heirarchy

    Leader : 
        Main leader server. When other servers boot up, they must inform the leader about their presence, 
        then the leader can let everyone else know about the new server. 
    Follower: 
        Follower servers. These are like followers from raft, where if they funnel metadata about all requests
        to leaders. They gather metadata from files requested by users to add, send it to the leader, who 
        then will make the decision on whom should actually store the file (possibly multiple, idk yet).


Process for storing a new file:
    Follower receives a request to add a new file from a client machine, client will send metadata of 
    the file like size, date modified (for conflicts), and more (idk yet), to the receiver. The receiver 
    forwards this to the leader (transparent to client, they don't know the leader or the existence of any leader),
    Leader looks at the metadatam, analyzes the numbers brrrr and decides which follower to send the file to. 
    The follower(s) will create a connection with the client, and the clients file sends on away. 

    In the background, each follower must know about this new file addition, so the leader sends this file metadata
    to everyone, and they run RAFT algo in the background in order to sync this file metadata across all nodes, 
    so they have a consistent metadata for all the files.
